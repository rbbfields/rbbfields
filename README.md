- 👋 Hi, I’m @rbbfields
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning from my current job as an Orchestra Librarian to a career in Web Development. My hobbies include singing, genealogy (traditional and genetic), Cornish studies (language, culture, history), painting, and generally learning new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on group projects for practice.
- 📫 You can email me at rbbfields.dev@gmail.com.
